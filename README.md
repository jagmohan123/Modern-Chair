# About
The Modern Chair Project is a sleek, user-friendly web application that showcases a range of contemporary chairs. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application allows users to explore different chair designs, select their preferred colors, and add their chosen items to a shopping cart. This project combines aesthetic design with practical functionality to create an engaging shopping experience.

# Features
# Color Selection:

# Dynamic Color Swatches: 
Users can choose from a variety of colors for each chair model. Color swatches are displayed beneath each chair, and clicking on a swatch updates the chair image to reflect the selected color.
# Real-Time Preview: 
The chair image updates in real-time as users select different colors, providing an immediate visual representation of their choice.
Add to Cart:

# Interactive Cart Button: 
Each chair has an "Add to Cart" button. When clicked, the selected chair (along with the chosen color) is added to the user's shopping cart.
# Cart Summary:
A cart summary section displays the items added to the cart, including chair model, color, and quantity. Users can view this summary at any time during their shopping session.
Local Storage: The cart data is stored using local storage, ensuring that the items persist even if the user navigates away from the page or refreshes the browser.
# Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the web pages, including the display of chair images, color swatches, and cart information.
CSS: Utilizes modern styling techniques to create an attractive and responsive design. CSS transitions and animations enhance user interaction, particularly when selecting colors and adding items to the cart.
JavaScript: Powers the dynamic functionalities of the application. JavaScript is used to handle events (such as color selection and adding items to the cart), update the DOM in real-time, and manage cart data through local storage.
